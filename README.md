### A LIVE WORKSHOP I ATTENDED AT UYO ZKWORKSHOP EVENT
I learnt the leo programming language, the basic structure on how to name a program, use of transition, records
- Naming a Leo program will have to start with a lowercase letter and must not be too short to avoid hight cost gas fee
- Transition are the core function for on-chain function in the Leo program
- Records are declaration of user/data components, every record will be generated and will only be viewed with the use of the View key in the Leo wallet

i Deployed a simple hello world program in Leo using the command below.
## Leo command
`leo run main 3u32 8u32` to add the input 3u32 and 8u32 to give `11u32`
